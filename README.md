# PhotinoEx

PhotinoEx is a Fork of [Photino](https://github.com/tryphotino) aiming to fix up bugs, add features and move one part of the project from C++ to C#.

I'm hoping this will make it easier to debug and develop on.

Currently do not use this in production. Once feature parity is done, i'll start working on some fixes/features from the old repo.

## Requirements

- Dotnet 10.
- An IDE supporting C# and Dotnet.
    - I will recommend [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) but VisualStudio should also work fine.

## Build from CLI

```
git clone https://github.com/PhotinoEx/PhotinoEx.git PhotinoEx
cd PhotinoEx
dotnet build
```

## Photino
Photino contained three packages:
- [Blazor](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Blazor)
- [NET](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET)
- [Native](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Native)

The Native Library has been rewritten to C# and the NET lib has been consolidated into Core with that.

## Clipboard

Blazor components can copy text through the native operating-system clipboard:

```razor
@inject PhotinoEx.Blazor.IPhotinoExClipboard Clipboard

<button @onclick="Copy">Copy</button>

@code {
    private Task Copy() => Clipboard.CopyTextAsync("Text to copy").AsTask();
}
```

Files and directories can be copied together. Directories are copied recursively by the operating system when pasted, so no recursive flag is required:

```csharp
await Clipboard.CopyFilesAsync(
    ["/path/to/report.pdf", "/path/to/folder"]
);
```
